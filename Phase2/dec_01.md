** WRITE README.MD File

##setup instructions:
- Have the emulator running before we enter the room
- play a few games beforehand so the scoreboard is loaded
    -make sure to play with different accounts so they can see user functionality
-make sure the unittest coverage is set to the correct classes
-go into the presentation with saved games that are already almost finished
