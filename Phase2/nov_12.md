#meeting in nov. 12th lab

##2 new games: one will be a memory game and one will be sudoku

##sudoku **kelvin and maggie
for now, kelvin and maggie will work on creating the implementation of sudoku
Sam will help with implementation of undo in this game
Automatic save will also be in this game
**create a way of scoring the games!

##memory  ** sam and wilson
-a card flipping game, sam and wilson will work on creating the implementation of this card game
**create a way of scoring the games!
-players will be scored based on moves made (since the game gets harder as time elapses, we will
not penalize players for taking longer)
-We will allow save in this game as well, as well as perhaps autosave

##making sure sliding tiles has a solvable board every time ** carlos
- carlos will work on making sure every slidingtiles board is solvable:
- either use the online method of ensuring its solvable or use our idea of starting from a solved
board and randomly make moves on a solved board

##Unittests:
- we will decide in a subsequent meeting who writes which Junit tests
- we are aiming for 100 % code coverage, which can be achieved using the MVC design pattern

**make sure to refactor frequently!!
**make sure to make your own subdirectories for each game!!
**make sure to use SOLID principles!!
